# LinkedIn Post Generator

An AI-powered pipeline that fetches trending AI news, tracks what's buzzing, and writes research-backed LinkedIn draft posts — entirely through Claude agents and subagents. No traditional code steps.

---

## Architecture

The pipeline is a **multi-agent system** where an orchestrator spawns specialised subagents:

```
orchestrator.md
├── .claude/agents/news-gatherer.md      → fetches + scores RSS articles
├── .claude/agents/trending-tracker.md   → finds trending keyword phrases
├── .claude/agents/post-generator.md     → writes & saves LinkedIn post drafts
└── .claude/agents/notion-publisher.md   → publishes drafts to Notion (optional)
```

Each agent is a self-contained markdown file with its own role, tools, and input/output contract. The orchestrator passes data between them — no Python glue code required.

## How to Run

### Inside Claude Code (the only way to run this)

Open this project in Claude Code and say:

```
Run the LinkedIn Post Generator pipeline.
```

Claude Code will read `orchestrator.md` and execute the full pipeline:
1. Spawns **news-gatherer** → reads RSS feeds via WebFetch, returns scored articles
2. Spawns **trending-tracker** → searches trending AI topics via WebSearch
3. For each article cluster, spawns **post-generator** → writes and saves a draft
4. Spawns **notion-publisher** → pushes drafts to Notion (if `NOTION_PAGE_ID` is set)

### Custom parameters

```
Run the LinkedIn Post Generator pipeline. Generate 3 posts. Use 5 articles per cluster.
```

```
Run the pipeline in dry-run mode — fetch and rank news only, don't generate posts.
```

## Configuration

All settings live in `config/` as standalone, independently editable files:

| File | Purpose | Edit to… |
|------|---------|----------|
| `config/topics.yaml` | Companies, keywords, and freshness settings | Add/remove companies and keywords to track |
| `config/sources.yaml` | RSS feeds and API sources | Add/remove news feeds; toggle any source off |
| `config/brand_kit.yaml` | Author identity, hashtag strategy, focus areas | Update your name, title, brand angles |
| `config/tone_of_voice.yaml` | Writing style, voice traits, forbidden words, character limits | Adjust how every post sounds and reads |
| `config/post_templates.yaml` | 7 post-type templates (launch, funding, hot take, etc.) | Customise hook patterns and structure for each story type |

Edit any file directly — changes take effect on the next pipeline run with no restarts needed.

### Post Templates

The `post-generator` agent automatically selects the best template from `config/post_templates.yaml` based on the news cluster:

| Template ID | Used when… |
|-------------|-----------|
| `FEATURE_LAUNCH` | An AI product, model, or feature was released |
| `FUNDING_NEWS` | A startup raised a round, was acquired, or went public |
| `I_TRIED_THIS` | You tested a tool personally and have honest results |
| `HOT_TAKE` | Multiple stories reveal a contrarian pattern worth naming |
| `BIG_TECH_NEWS` | Microsoft, Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, or Nvidia made an AI move |
| `RESEARCH_BREAKTHROUGH` | A research paper or capability milestone was published |
| `VIDEO_RELEASE` | An AI company released a YouTube video or product demo |

Each generated post records `template_used` in its frontmatter so you can see which template was applied.

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

```bash
# Required for Notion publishing (optional feature)
NOTION_PAGE_ID=your_32char_page_id_here

# Optional: direct Notion REST API fallback
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_xxx

# Optional: NewsAPI for additional sources
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Output

Generated posts are saved to `posts/` as markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```
posts/
  2024-01-15_10-30-00_openai-launches-gpt5.md
  2024-01-15_10-30-00_anthropic-funding-round.md
```

Each file contains:
- **YAML frontmatter**: source metadata, companies, categories, trending keywords, status
- **Post body**: the full LinkedIn draft, ready to review and publish

Change `status: draft` to `status: published` to track what's gone live.
